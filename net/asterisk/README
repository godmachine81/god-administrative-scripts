The configuration files inside this directory are a simple set of preconfigured rules to get 
inbound/outbound calls to/from google voice to work with asterisk. It is very important you 
read the comments especially in the dial plan (extensions.conf) and sip (sip.conf) before you
can expect this to work. These asterisk configs should be used mainly as a reference.
